    raise_on_status=False, backoff_factor=0.5, **_ANY_METHOD)

 ```
 
Just do the following steps
- Go the following path
  ```console
  C:\Users\<NAME>\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\firebase_admin_http_client.py
  ```
- Comment the following lines from firebase_admin_http_client.py:
  ```console
   #from requests.packages.urllib3.util import retry
   #DEFAULT_RETRY_CONFIG = retry.Retry(
   #connect=1, read=1, status=4, status_forcelist=[500, 503],
   #raise_on_status=False, backoff_factor=0.5)
  ```
- Also Change the init parameter as follows
```console
def __init__(
  self, credential=None, session=None, base_url='', headers=None,
  retries=1,timeout=120):
```
